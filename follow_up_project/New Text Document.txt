What do we want: erase as much of the 'randomness' in the infection as possible
How to do this: Set beta to 1. Now infection is always transmitted. 
Do not use gamma but a constant amount of timestamp for the infection duration. 
This duration should be dependent on how the infection grows in the network. 

What did I try:
get the time it takes for the infection to go from 20 to 40 or 40 to 60 percent of nodes. 
Take this time around 800 or 1600 timestamps. Problem: there seem to be some 'pauses' in the data. 
So the infection time should be longer than these pauses for the infection to sustain. 
Now I used the amount of timesteps to go from 80% infected to 90% when beta is 1 and for no removal of nodes.

Haggle:
Tried to do the same for haggle, problem with this dataset. 
Dataset has over 300000 timestamps so matrix for removed gets to large. Most timestamps are not used.
ideas: Cropped the data, every 20 timestamps are now 1 timestamp. Since most jumps are around 100 ts, should not be a problem.



Idea: erase all timestamps where nothing happens??

# of nodes
# of contacts per timestamp per nodes?? 
# of timestamps untill all a certain percentage of nodes is infected
